World Layoffs Data Analysis (SQL)

This repository contains a SQL-based project focused on cleaning and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of company layoffs. The aim of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in SQL for data manipulation, cleaning, and the identification of significant trends and patterns within a real-world dataset.

Project Summary
This project's primary purpose is to leverage SQL for a comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis of a global layoffs dataset. The goal is to uncover meaningful trends and patterns related to company layoffs across various dimensions such as company, location, country, year, and industry. By meticulously cleaning and analyzing the data, the project aims to showcase robust SQL skills in handling real-world data challenges and extracting actionable insights, including identifying critical events like complete company shutdowns.

Files
1. Data Cleaning Project World Layoffs 2022.sql: This SQL script contains all the necessary queries for the entire project. It covers the initial data inspection, creation of a staging table, identification and removal of duplicates, standardization of various data fields (e.g., industry names, country names, date formats), handling of null values, and the core exploratory data analysis queries. This file serves as a complete record of the data manipulation and analysis process.

Steps Performed
The project followed a structured approach to data cleaning and analysis:

Staging Table Creation: A layoffs_staging table was created as a copy of the original layoffs table to ensure the raw data remained untouched, allowing for safe modifications and iterations.

Duplicate Removal: Identified and removed duplicate rows based on a combination of key columns (company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, date, stage, country, funds_raised_millions) to ensure data uniqueness and accuracy. A temporary row_num column was added to facilitate this process.

Data Standardization:

Industry: Standardized industry names (e.g., consolidating 'Crypto Currency' and 'CryptoCurrency' to 'Crypto'). Handled empty strings by converting them to NULL and then populating them where possible by joining on company name.

Country: Cleaned country names by trimming trailing periods (e.g., 'United States.' to 'United States').

Date Format: Converted the date column from a text format (%m/%d/%Y) to a proper DATE data type for accurate temporal analysis.

Null Value Handling: Assessed null values in total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, and funds_raised_millions. Decided to retain these nulls as they are meaningful for calculations during the EDA phase. Rows where both total_laid_off and percentage_laid_off were NULL were removed as they provided no useful information.

Column Cleanup: Removed the temporary row_num column after duplicate removal was completed.

Results
Upon executing the SQL script, the following insights are expected to be derived:

Overall Layoff Trends: Identification of the total number of layoffs and the percentage of workforce reductions over time.

Company-Specific Impact: A clear understanding of which companies have conducted the most layoffs, both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of their workforce, including those with 100% layoffs indicating complete shutdowns.

Industry-Specific Vulnerability: Insights into which industries have been most affected by layoffs, highlighting sectors experiencing significant contractions.

Geographical Distribution: Analysis of layoff occurrences by location and country, revealing regions most impacted by workforce reductions.

Temporal Patterns: Identification of peak periods for layoffs, allowing for an understanding of the economic or market conditions that might have contributed to these events.

Funding Correlation: Potential correlations between funds raised by companies and their layoff activities.

Recommendations
Based on the insights gained from this analysis, future steps could include:

Deeper Dive into Specific Events: Investigate the reasons behind significant layoff events for particular companies or industries, potentially by integrating external economic or news data.

Predictive Modeling: Utilize the cleaned and analyzed data to build predictive models for future layoff trends, potentially incorporating machine learning techniques.

Interactive Dashboards: Create interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or even web-based visualizations (e.g., D3.js) to make the insights more accessible and explorable for a wider audience.

Comparative Analysis: Compare layoff trends across different economic cycles or with other relevant economic indicators to provide broader context.

Stakeholder Reporting: Develop concise reports for various stakeholders (e.g., investors, policymakers, job seekers) summarizing key findings and their implications.

Technologies Used
SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible): For all data cleaning, transformation, and analytical queries.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various company layoffs. (Specific details about the dataset, such as its source or columns, can be added here if available).

How to Use
Database Setup: Import the raw layoff data into your SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

Run SQL Script: Execute the queries in 1. Data Cleaning Project World Layoffs 2022.sql in sequence. This script will create the necessary staging tables, clean the data, and perform the described analyses.

Explore Results: Review the output of the queries to understand the trends and patterns identified in the layoff data.
