World Layoffs Data Analysis (SQL)
This repository contains a SQL-based project focused on cleaning and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of company layoffs. The aim of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in SQL for data manipulation, cleaning, and the identification of significant trends and patterns within a real-world dataset.

Project Overview
The project involves a comprehensive analysis of layoff data, covering various dimensions to uncover insights into the global layoff landscape. Key areas of exploration include:

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Creation of a staging table to preserve raw data integrity.

Identification and removal of duplicate entries.

Standardization of data (e.g., industry names, country names, date formats).

Handling of null values to ensure data quality for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Trend Identification: Analyzing layoffs by company, location, country, year, and industry to identify overarching trends and patterns.

Impact Assessment: Examining layoff percentages to pinpoint companies that underwent significant workforce reductions, including instances of 100% layoffs, indicating complete company shutdowns. This demonstrates attention to detail and the ability to identify critical data points.

Technologies Used
SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible): For all data cleaning, transformation, and analytical queries.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various company layoffs. (Specific details about the dataset, such as its source or columns, can be added here if available).

Project Structure
1. Data Cleaning Project World Layoffs 2022.sql: This file contains all the SQL queries for data cleaning, standardization, and the initial exploratory data analysis.

How to Use
Database Setup: Import the raw layoff data into your SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

Run SQL Script: Execute the queries in 1. Data Cleaning Project World Layoffs 2022.sql in sequence. This script will create the necessary staging tables, clean the data, and perform the described analyses.

Explore Results: Review the output of the queries to understand the trends and patterns identified in the layoff data.

Key Insights (Examples - These would be populated after running the analysis)
Top industries most affected by layoffs.

Countries with the highest number of layoffs.

Companies that experienced the most significant workforce reductions.

Yearly trends in layoff events.

Future Enhancements
Further in-depth statistical analysis.

Integration with a visualization tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) for interactive dashboards.

Time-series analysis to predict future layoff trends.
